8,Bounty Awarded,bounty,"We define a bounty as a monetary award given by the development team to a researcher who discovered a vulnerability. Bounties garner a wide variety of monetary rewards, depending on a variety of factors. The severity of the vulnerablity at the time of its discovery is a main driver [1,3], however.

Bounties also create an interesting economy that competes with the black-hat economy of a vulnerability [2]. Knowledge of a vulnerability can be very profitable for attackers. So software companies will defray this cost by giving out bounties. Thus, bounty awards are inextricably linked to their black market value.

Below are some interesting publications on the topic of bug bounty programs and vulnerabilities.

38,CWE-361: 7PK - Time and State,cwe-361,"""This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses related to the improper management of time and state in an environment that supports simultaneous or near-simultaneous computation by multiple systems, processes, or threads. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, ""Distributed computation is about time and state. That is, in order for more than one component to communicate, state must be shared, and all that takes time. Most programmers anthropomorphize their work. They think about one thread of control carrying out the entire program in the same way they would if they had to do the job themselves. Modern computers, however, switch between tasks very quickly, and in multi-core, multi-CPU, or distributed systems, two events may take place at exactly the same time. Defects rush to fill the gap between the programmer's model of how a program executes and what happens in reality. These defects are related to unexpected interactions between threads, processes, time, and information. These interactions happen through shared state: semaphores, variables, the file system, and, basically, anything that can store information."""" - For more infomration visit https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/361.html

Familiarity is difficult to gain with code. Even for the best
developers, contributing to a piece of source code for the first time
means that they must understand the design decisions from previous
developers, any issues the code has had historically, and the coding
style. Thus, the first commit any developer makes is risky.

Furthermore, research has shown a strong correlation between code that
had many developers and code with vulnerabilities.

Write about diffusion of responsibility.

Provide a few paragraphs and references about how having multiple
developers work on a piece of code increases its liklihood of having a
vulnerability.

Note that we used 10 as an arbitrary threshold, but it's really more of
a spectrum.

Most software project don't make a definitive list of their subsystems, so the subsystems tags are our curators' best guess at what part(s) of the system a vulnerability was in. Often, curators will look at file paths primarily, but may also look at bug reports or commit messages to make this determination.

375,VCC,vcc,"A **vulnerability-contributing commit** is a commit that we believe is the origin of a vulnerability in source control. If a vulnerability has this tag, then we have found at least one VCC for it. 

We use a modified version of the [SZZ algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1082983.1083147) using the [archeogit](https://github.com/samaritan/archeogit) built by Nuthan Munaiah to identify VCCs. In short, this algorithm uses `git blame` functionality to trace individual lines of code back to their origins. Curators are asked to verify if the VCCs are valid, so these have manual curations as well.
