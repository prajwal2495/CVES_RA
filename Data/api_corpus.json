The reason for using a resource like a shadow DOM is allow \nfor a controllable boundary between the actual implementation of various items\nlike a slider, and the use of them.

For example,\nthe function set_http_transaction_factory was called on both the main and media\ncontext variables. However, it seems that when the developer was writing the\ncode to call the function set_ftp_transaction_factory, they accidentally forgot\nabout the media context variable and only set the FTP transaction factory on\nthe main context variable. This led to no FtpTransaction objects being created\nfor media over FTP.\n\nThis might have been prevented if the developer was more careful when creating\nthe file, practiced pair programming, or if the code had undergone a more\nthorough code review before being released.\n"},{"id":484,"cve":"CVE-2011-3084","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":485,"cve":"CVE-2011-3085","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":486,"cve":"CVE-2011-3086","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":487,"cve":"CVE-2011-3087","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":488,"cve":"CVE-2011-3088","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":489,"cve":"CVE-2011-3089","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":490,"cve":"CVE-2011-3090","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":491,"cve":"CVE-2011-3091","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":493,"cve":"CVE-2011-3093","project_name":"chromium","description":"","mistakes":null},{"id":494,"cve":"CVE-2011-3094","project_name":"chromium","description":"The input validation vulnerability did not properly handle Tibetan text, and thus an\nout-of-bounds read could occur during Tibetan handling.

Unicode supports characters from both classifications.  Strings made up of both LTR and RTL characters must be displayed in a specific order using the bidirectional text (bidi) algorithm.\nIn this vulnerability, on Chrome for Android, when a user entered a URL into the address bar, if the first strong character (A character with a clear direction, either LTR or RTL.  Usually an alphabetic character) in the URL is RTL, an attacker could construct a URL that was displayed in reverse, introducing address bar spoofing by constructing URLs that appear to be visiting one domain but are actually visiting some malicious site.\nFor example, in the URL 127.0.0.1/ا/http://example.com , the first strong character from LTR is ا.  This character causes the neutral characters (numbers and punctuation) preceding it to take on the RTL direction, while http://example.com remains LTR.  As a result, the URL is displayed as http://example.com/‭ا/127.0.0.1, with the LTR segment appearing before the RTL segment.\nThe displayed URL is an example of address bar spoofing because it leads the user to believe they are visiting example.com, when they are actually navigating to localhost.

This issue\naffects version 2.4.10 only.\n\nWhen an Apache HTTPD server is sent a long HTTP header from a FastCGI server, there is\na potential for a buffer overflow error. Apache HTTPD will read long headers and end up\nreading memory past the end of the header that was sent in. This caused denial of service\nissues due to the potential for segmentation faults from buffer overflow.\n\nFastCGI is a protocol (similar to how HTTP is a protocol) that allows servers to execute\nCGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts on a web server. CGI is used as middleware to \nallow servers to pass data to/from an application or web server. For example, CGI could be\nused to send data between a database and web server.\n","mistakes":"This was a coding mistake, and to an extent, a design mistake. When Apache was\ninitially writing this function, they assumed that any header coming in from another\nserver would include the buffer end character, '\\0'. This null character is the only\nmechanism that stops C from reading memory past the end of the string. \n\nIn C, every string allocated includes a null character at the end. However, the\nvulnerability specifically relates to large headers coming specficially from a remote\nFastCGI server. One good principal in secure coding is to not trust an input's validity\nif it is coming from outside a trust boundary. In this case, the Apache developers\nplaced too much trust on the assumption that any header would include a null character.\nIt lead to them writing code that relied solely on the existence of an end character in input\nto prevent overflow errors. The developers should have not trusted the validity of \noutside input and placed checks to prevent memory from being read\n\nThe fix is extremely simple - check the length of an incoming string and read only up to the \nlength of that string. This is a good fix, since there isn't a reliance on outside input - the\nheaders are checked after they are received. Another potential fix Apache could consider\nimplementing is to simply limit the length of the headers, since this vulnerability specifically\nappears on headers over a certain length. The drawback of this approach is that it may be temporary.\nBecause HTTP standards are always changing, longer headers may be the norm in the future and such\na fix will eventually have to be re-fixed properly in the future.\n\nThe mistake can also be considered a design mistake. It was interesting to see that the vulnerability\naffected this module specifically. HTTP headers are not unique to FastCGI - they come from everywhere.\nThe question becomes how many other modules are doing their own HTTP header parsing, and why would\nonly this module specifically be affected?

The trouble with this originally is due to the very complex nature of possible\nvalid URLs, meaning that creating a regular expression to check for all improper URLs is a \nfairly daunting task. To prevent this issue in similiar situations in the future, I would \nrecommend to create a list of all blacklisted symbols, phrases, and/or possible malicious\ninputs, then test each one against the created regex to verify it sanitizes the input correctly.\n"},{"id":1872,"cve":"CVE-2016-6795","project_name":"struts","description":"The URL provided by the user was not fully validated which could cause the server to let an attacker go to locations \nnot permitted to view and even inject code to execute remotely\n","mistakes":"This looks like a coding mistake.
