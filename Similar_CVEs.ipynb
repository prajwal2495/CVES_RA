This would allow a remote attacker to arbitrarily execute code on a user's machine.

OpenJPEG is an open source library used to display JPEG images; this was a dependency in PDFium, which is an open source library which Google maintains. This is used to display PDF files through Google Chrome.\\nThis bug in OpenJPEG was brought forth through a developer of the open source library attempting to close another Heap Buffer Overflow bug. I think that this vulnerability could have been stopped in its tracks if there had been unit tests for this section of code, as there are no unit tests in OpenJPEG.\",\n",
