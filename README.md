# The Vulverability History Project
Andy Menely, Prajwal Krishna, Paridhi Khandelwal

This project is based on finding the similarities with the vulnerability id's and we are trying to experiment with Machine Learning techniques both classification and clustering techniques for now. This would help any software developer trying to find a solution for a bug as we would keep the similar vulnerabilties with the solution to be looked upon. The similarities are based on the description and the mistakes given in the data. 

## Data
These are the known vulnerabilities in our database(refer website). Every vulnerability known to the VHP project is reported here, regardless of what the state of its curation is.

Each vulnerability is given upvotes  by our curators. Upvotes are an entirely subjective measure of how interesting the story each curator finds the vulnerability. Everyone is encouraged to contribute upvotes to vulnerabilities! 

These vulnerabilities are stored in the Data Folder and we have used corpus.json and api_tags.json and similar csv files for our project.

## Installation
You would need any IDE to run the python code and following are some of the common packages required to do natural language processing for the data and work on ML models:

numpy
pandas
sklearn
string
keras
tensorflow
pytorch
pickle

Clone the repository using:
$git clone https://github.com/prajwal2495/CVES_RA.git


## Usage
This would help any software developer trying to find a solution for a bug as we would keep the similar vulnerabilties with the solution to be looked upon. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
