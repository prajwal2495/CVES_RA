On the Chromium team's internal comments, there was mention of \\nthis issue also occuring on firefox. I believe that this was created by a coding mistake.\\nThe team also mentioned that there was a quick fix in place that did not cover the edge case\\nof this vulnerability-when the first frame of the gif is larger than the screen size.\\n\\nThe CWE associated with this vulnerability is concerned with memory use after a free, because\\nof the error that occurs after the before mentioned issue with gif frame sizes. There are two\\nsuggested mitigatons in the CWE entry. The first mitigation suggests choosing a language that \\nprovides automatic memory management. For a engine such as blink that is quite large, it is not\\nrealistic to rewrite the rendering engine in a new language. The second mitigation is to be sure\\nto set your variables to NULL after they are freed, but even the mitigation strategy mentions \\nthat this fix may not be very useful if there are multiple of complex data structures, and blink\\nis a very complicated engine.\\n\\nHowever, considering they fixed the issue at its root cause(mishandling gif decoding), and changed\\nthe quick fix, it seems like the fix was handled properly.</th>\n",

There is quite a bit of reliance on untrusted shared memory here because of the\\nway that the different processes communicate with each other, and this is part of the\\narchitecture for this application, which means it is very difficult to change. This\\nreliance, combined with the complexity that comes naturally with concurrent processes,\\nexposes the application to a myriad of issues that may be very difficult to identify.\\n\\nMoreover, there were multiple code design flaws that overlooked the atomicity of certain\\noperations in the code. In other words, by looking at the VCC and comparing it with the\\nfix, it seemed like the original code was using the \"easiest\" path to retrieve data in\\nshared memory, even when these operations were not atomic and introduced the possibility\\nof race conditions. And since this code had been present for years before the fix, it\\npropagated to other parts of the system. In fact, there was even some discussion in the\\nbug report about volatile memory in other parts of the code that was not identified as such,\\nso this vulnerability exposed other maintainability issues that required more time and effort\\nfrom the developers.\\n\\nFinally, the fix seems to implement some proper ways to deal with the race condition issue,\\nspecifically the use of volatile type modifiers in the code to indicate the use of untrusted\\nshared memory. In addition, the fix also introduces a better use of atomic operations by avoiding\\nhaving to calculate, access, or write to shared memory more times than is necessary.</th>\n",

In the bug report, the Google employees are specifically\\nreferencing the mozilla bug report forum and their proposed solution. It's\\nreally quite interesting to see collaboration between the two giant browsers.\\nThe Chromium team debated with other options for the fix, but ultimately ended\\nup going with Firefox's proposed solution of locking down the window's\\nprototype chain.\\n\\nThe fix for this originally ended up being quite simple, by adding a nosniff\\noption in HTTP headers, but eventually the bug was re-opened and a new, more\\ncomplicated, solution needed to be found (mentioned above). It seems the HTTP\\nheader option was merely a step in the correct direction (this is now\\ndefault in modern browsers).\\n\\nAs for the CWE entry, I found it very diffiuclt to pin down exactly which\\nbroad CWE category this fits into. After much silent debate, I decided to\\ncategorize it as XSS because ultimately, external JS code was being executed\\nthat was not meant to be executed (even if it was via a proxy, aka not via\\nthe site directly). It also directly relates to a violation of the Same\\nOrigin Policy. Even though it's a bit strange, and therefore doesn't\\nnecessarily have the mitigations recommended for broad XSS, there are some\\nthat are still aparent. For example, I think the most applicable mitigation\\nis actually Strategy: Attack Surface Reduction. This basically involves\\nkeeping in mind all potential areas where untrusted inputs are possible,\\nincluding things read from the network, URL components, external systems, etc.\\nThis relates to the fact that the Chromium team had to think about a Harmony\\nProxy as an area with untrusted input.</th>\n",

       "      <th>This was a coding mistake, and to an extent, a design mistake. When Apache was\\ninitially writing this function, they assumed that any header coming in from another\\nserver would include the buffer end character, '\\0'. This null character is the only\\nmechanism that stops C from reading memory past the end of the string. \\n\\nIn C, every string allocated includes a null character at the end. However, the\\nvulnerability specifically relates to large headers coming specficially from a remote\\nFastCGI server. One good principal in secure coding is to not trust an input's validity\\nif it is coming from outside a trust boundary. In this case, the Apache developers\\nplaced too much trust on the assumption that any header would include a null character.\\nIt lead to them writing code that relied solely on the existence of an end character in input\\nto prevent overflow errors. The developers should have not trusted the validity of \\noutside input and placed checks to prevent memory from being read\\n\\nThe fix is extremely simple - check the length of an incoming string and read only up to the \\nlength of that string. This is a good fix, since there isn't a reliance on outside input - the\\nheaders are checked after they are received. Another potential fix Apache could consider\\nimplementing is to simply limit the length of the headers, since this vulnerability specifically\\nappears on headers over a certain length. The drawback of this approach is that it may be temporary.\\nBecause HTTP standards are always changing, longer headers may be the norm in the future and such\\na fix will eventually have to be re-fixed properly in the future.\\n\\nThe mistake can also be considered a design mistake. It was interesting to see that the vulnerability\\naffected this module specifically. HTTP headers are not unique to FastCGI - they come from everywhere.\\nThe question becomes how many other modules are doing their own HTTP header parsing, and why would\\nonly this module specifically be affected? It may be prudent for Apache to consider a single HTTP\\nheader parser so that the entire code base can reference one uniform parser.</th>\n",

The out of sync resource would allow remote \\nattackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact\\nthrough arbitrary code execution (hackers could craft their own code which the\\nprogram would run blindly).  This is because the function, when it crashes, \\ngives the attacker semi-reliable control of the stack of the chrome system.\\nThe stack is the set of instructions the program will run in order.  \\nControl of the stack means the user has control over what the program will \\nexecute next. The reason for using a resource like a shadow DOM is allow \\nfor a controllable boundary between the actual implementation of various items\\nlike a slider, and the use of them. Rather than requiring users to code every last\\npiece of everything on webpages, shadow DOMs are used to give developers access\\nto elements that the implementers of the framework want you to have access to,\\nwithout exposing the framwork itself.  Think of a shadow DOM as a way for\\nframweork developers to let webpage developers work with complex pre-built \\nitems like various kinds of input sliders or video frames, without exposing\\nthe code for how those reach into the framework itself, all the while allowing\\nthe user to both utilize, customize, and stylize those elements.  The problem\\nthat was encountered here for this vulnerability is that the shadow DOM was\\nnot being properly refreshed. When source images weren't loaded (the\\n<img> tag being the html component that is actually a secret call to items\\nin the shadow DOM that do some magic reaching into the framework), the DOM\\nwould suddenly have a refernce to items that were not actually on the current\\npage (memory gets allocated for an image, then the image is never actually\\nloaded, the DOM thinks there is an image but instead points to other mermory),\\nwhich exposed the system to hackers.This bug was introduced in one fell swoop after a large code rebase.  The team seemingly decided it was best to\\nutilize the shadow DOM (Document Object Model) to silently take care of loading images in the background.

It seems that the decision to utilize the shadow DOM \\nframework is still in use today.  So this commit introduced the newly accepted framework into the system, \\nand the bug that accompanied it.

This caused denial of service\\nissues due to the potential for segmentation faults from buffer overflow.\\n\\nFastCGI is a protocol (similar to how HTTP is a protocol) that allows servers to execute\\nCGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts on a web server. CGI is used as middleware to \\nallow servers to pass data to/from an application or web server. For example, CGI could be\\nused to send data between a database and web server.This was a coding mistake, and to an extent, a design mistake. When Apache was\\ninitially writing this function, they assumed that any header coming in from another\\nserver would include the buffer end character, '\\\\0'. This null character is the only\\nmechanism that stops C from reading memory past the end of the string. \\n\\nIn C, every string allocated includes a null character at the end. However, the\\nvulnerability specifically relates to large headers coming specficially from a remote\\nFastCGI server. One good principal in secure coding is to not trust an input's validity\\nif it is coming from outside a trust boundary. In this case, the Apache developers\\nplaced too much trust on the assumption that any header would include a null character.\\nIt lead to them writing code that relied solely on the existence of an end character in input\\nto prevent overflow errors. The developers should have not trusted the validity of \\noutside input and placed checks to prevent memory from being read\\n\\nThe fix is extremely simple - check the length of an incoming string and read only up to the \\nlength of that string. This is a good fix, since there isn't a reliance on outside input - the\\nheaders are checked after they are received. Another potential fix Apache could consider\\nimplementing is to simply limit the length of the headers, since this vulnerability specifically\\nappears on headers over a certain length. The drawback of this approach is that it may be temporary.\\nBecause HTTP standards are always changing, longer headers may be the norm in the future and such\\na fix will eventually have to be re-fixed properly in the future.\\n\\nThe mistake can also be considered a design mistake. It was interesting to see that the vulnerability\\naffected this module specifically. HTTP headers are not unique to FastCGI - they come from everywhere.\\nThe question becomes how many other modules are doing their own HTTP header parsing, and why would\\nonly this module specifically be affected? It may be prudent for Apache to consider a single HTTP\\nheader parser so that the entire code base can reference one uniform parser.\",\n",

       " 'Apache Tomcat (An open source implementation of the Java Servlet) 5.5.x did not use a proper approach for handling a large number of parameters. There was no limit to the size of a request so attackers could utilize this to cause a denial of service via requests that contained many parameters which in turn caused a large amount of CPU to be used. The vulnerability was handled by making Tomcat parameter handling code efficiently process large numbers of parameters and parameter values.From what I have seen, it seems like a design mistake led to this vulnerability. It appears that when created, the original code did not account for the possibly of large/excessive parameters.This could be due to the fact that the developer never anticipated that their system could be abused in such a way. I also found it interesting that the vulnerability was found from investigating another vulnerability. This shows that it is important to consider how 1 vulnerability may be applied or affect another part of a system.']"
